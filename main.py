Blackjack
The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by having a higher card total
without going over 21.
(This simulation excludes some additional actions like doubling down,
 splitting, and insurance to keep it simple.)
Rules:
    Card Values
        - 2 to 10 = Face Value
        - J, Q, K = 10
        - Ace = 1 or 11
    Definitions
        - Blackjack = an Ace and a card worth 10 points (21 total)
        - Hand = cards holding by a player
        - Hole = the dealerâ€™s card that is face down
        - Hit = draw another card
        - Stand = take no more cards
        - Bust = going over 21
    How to play
        - The players place a bet by putting the desired number of chips.
        - The dealer deals two cards face up to the player.
        - The dealer receives one card face up and one face down.
        - The player can choose whether he/she want to hit or stand.
        - Then, the dealer can choose whether he/she want to hit or stand.
    Winning
        - If the player busts, he/she loses immediately
        - If the player's hand value is higher than the dealer's
        (or the dealer busts), he/she wins 1:1 his/her bet.
        - If the player's hand value is lower than the dealer's
        (or the dealer busts), he/she loses his/her bet.
        - If the player's hand value is equal to the dealer's
        (or the dealer busts), the player receives his bet back.
        - If the player gets Blackjack, he/she wins 3:2 his/her bet.
        - If the player and the dealer both get Blackjack,
        the player receives his bet back.
